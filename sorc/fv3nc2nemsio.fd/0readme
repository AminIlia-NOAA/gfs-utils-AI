Note that FV3 lat-lon grids are located at the center of each grid box, 
start from south to north, and from east to west.
For example, for a 0.5-deg uniform grid,
nlon=720, nlat=360
X(1,1)=[0.25E,89.75S]
X(nlon,nlat)=[359.75E,89.75N]

write out nemsio, S->N is reversed to N->S to follow NCEP convention
